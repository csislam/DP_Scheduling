This repository contains research and implementation related to **Dual Priority Scheduling (DP_Scheduling)** within the [Litmus-RT](https://github.com/LITMUS-RT/litmus-rt) framework. The project explores how **Dual Priority Scheduling** can enhance the **predictability, efficiency, and performance** of real-time systems.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Real-time systems require predictable and efficient scheduling to guarantee timing constraints. **Dual Priority Scheduling (DP_Scheduling)** is a fixed-priority algorithm that dynamically changes task priorities between two levels (high and low).  

By integrating DP_Scheduling into **Litmus-RT**, this research investigates:
- Improved schedulability analysis
- Reduced response times for critical tasks
- Enhanced overall system utilization
- Practical feasibility on Linux-based real-time platforms

## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/csislam/DP_Scheduling.git
   cd DP_Scheduling
Ensure you have Litmus-RT installed and patched kernel. Refer to the Litmus-RT setup guide.

Apply the DP_Scheduling patch:

bash
Copy code
patch -p1 < dp_scheduling.patch
Rebuild and install the kernel:

bash
Copy code
make
sudo make install
ðŸš€ Usage
Configure your real-time tasks using Litmus-RT APIs.

Select DP_Scheduling as the scheduling policy:

bash
Copy code
sudo setsched dp_scheduling <pid>
Run experiments with tasksets and measure performance metrics.

Example:

bash
Copy code
sudo ./run_experiment.sh --policy dp_scheduling --tasks taskset.json
